# Cost-Estimator
The script calculates the cost of flooring for a room based on user input for dimensions and material choices. The program also allows users to save project details to a file.

## MRAC01(24/25): Hardware II - Assignment 01
  - This project serves as an opportunity for students with architectural background to learn Python. It assumes that the student is an absolute beginner and is used to teach the fundamental conecpts of Python through a hands on approach.
The project will be written as one script. The script calculates the cost of flooring for a room based on user input for dimensions and material choices. The program also allows users to save project details to a file.
The project consists of two parts, the basic and the custom version. Students are asked to complete the basic version, and then create a new script where they would implement the basic version integrating one of the expansion ideas listed below.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn basic Python syntax.
- Understand variables and data types.
- Work with conditional statements.
- Use loops for repetitive tasks (if expanded).
- Create and use functions.
- Work with lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- Learn basic file handling operations.
  
## Work Process
1. Input room length, width and height. 
2. Output - floor area.
3. Additional output - wall area.
4. Input floor assembly material from 3 types-- lvt, stone, tile
5. Additional input wall assembly from 4 types--steel, lumber, brick, tile, stone.
6. Output - floor cost (based on arbotrarilly assigned unit costs for each of the above listed building assemblies.)
7. Additional output - wall cost, and total material cost.
8. Additional output - labor cost, taxes, and overhead / profit (as fixed factors of material cost).
9. Option to write file to CSV.
